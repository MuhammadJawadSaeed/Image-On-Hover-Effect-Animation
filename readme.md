#  DOM Practice Project â€“ Hover Image Animation

This is an interactive **DOM manipulation** project where hovering over text reveals an associated image that follows the cursor. Built using **HTML**, **Sass (SCSS)**, and **JavaScript**, this project enhances visual interaction and demonstrates real-time DOM updates.

##  Project Purpose and Learning Goals

This project was developed as part of my **MERN stack learning journey**, focusing on improving my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills and creative front-end design. The goal was to build a hover-based interaction that enhances user experience and deepens my understanding of event handling and dynamic styling.

### Through this project, I practiced:

- Handling `mouseenter`, `mousemove`, and `mouseleave` events to trigger DOM updates.
- Dynamically controlling image position relative to mouse pointer.
- Using **Sass (SCSS)** to structure and maintain clean, modular styles.
- Creating a layout using **Flexbox** and layering content using **z-index** and **positioning**.
- Enhancing interactivity by showing and hiding elements based on user actions.

This project is a creative implementation of how DOM events and CSS effects can be combined to create an engaging user experience.
